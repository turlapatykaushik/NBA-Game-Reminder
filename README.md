# NBA-Game-Reminder
A Python Flask application that lets users select their favorite NBA team and then remind them of their team's game via Email Notification, on game days. NBA Api was used to extract the data of all the matches of 2021-22 NBA season. This data was stored in the MongoDB to be used for querying purposes. An index.html file was designed to capture the users favorite NBA team and their email addresses, store it in MongoDB. The program then makes use of Python's schedule library to trigger functions every day at midnight and send an email Notification using SMTP protocol to the user reminding them that their favorite team is playing their match today, along with the name of the opposition.
